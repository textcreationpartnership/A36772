            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Psalm is one of those Twelv that are marked in the fore-head with <hi>Maschil;</hi> that is, <hi>a Psalm giveing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It consisteth of as manie Verses as the year doth of Weeks, and hath, like the year, its Summer and Winter. The Summer-part is the former, wherein, the Church haveing reaped a most
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54874:7"/> rich crop, (the best Blessings of Heaven and Earth) the Psalmist breaketh forth into the praises of their gracious Benefactor, <hi>I will sing the mercies of the Lord for ever:</hi> so hee beginneth, and so hee goeth on a great way. Who now would expect anie thing but mercies, and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Summer all the way' But Summer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and Winter commenceth at v. 38. <hi>But thou hast cast off, and abhorred: thou hast been wroth with thine Anointed.</hi> Mercies and singing are now turned into troubles and mourning. But nothing shall you hear but bitter querimonies &amp; expostulations till you com to the last vers. There the good man com's to himself again. Though God were angrie with his People, hee cannot part with God in discontent. Though God had laden them with crosses, hee lift's up his head, and presents God with Blessings; <hi>Blessed bee the Lord for evermore, Amen and Amen.</hi> Hee blesseth him aswel for Winter as for Summer, for troubles as for mercies.</p>
            <p>And thus the last vers of the Psalm haveing as much affinitie with the first in matter, as the last day of the year hath with the first in season; if wee circle the Psalm, and bring both ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, wee finde a fit resemblance between the year and It.</p>
            <p>The Text is one of the Psalmist's Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drops; a black line from that Pen, which erst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while was so filled with Joy, and wrote nothing but Rubricks. Hee complaineth in the next precedent vers, of the Brevitie of his own life:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54874:7"/> (it was like a Winter's day, verie short.) in this, of the Instabilitie of Man's Life: as though hee had said, I am not the onely Mortal. Other mens lives, though haply cloathed with more comforts then mine, and extended to a greater length then mine, are altogether as mortal as mine; for his Interrogations are equipollent to strong Negations: <hi>There is no man liveing, that shall not see death, no man liveing that shall deliver his soul from the hand of the grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is death visible then? Hath the grave an hand? Is the soul subject to the grave? These I shall answer in the opening of the words.</p>

               <hi>And shall not see death?]</hi> To see death, as it is not a proper, so neither is it a common speech. It occurreth oftener in the New Testament then in the Old, yet but seldom there; Luke 2.26. <hi>It was revealed into him,</hi> (old Simeon) <hi>by the holie Ghost, that hee should not see death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had seen the Lord's Christ.</hi> John 8.51. <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee shall never see death.</hi> Hebr. 11.5. <hi>By faith Enoch was translated, that hee should not see death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Scripture speaketh of Sleep, Eccles. 8.16. <hi>There is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eies.</hi> And profane Writers also, <hi>I have not seen</hi>

               <hi>sleep with mine eies this night,</hi> saith hee in the Poet. And the Orator of

                  <hi>Caninio Consule</hi> scito neminem prandisse, nihil tamen eo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sule mali factum est.

               <hi>Consul Caninius; Hee was a wonderful vigilant man, that dureing the time of his Consul-ship, never saw sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like unto the phrase of <hi>Seeing death,</hi> is that of <hi>Tasteing</hi> it. Matth. 16.28. Mark 9.1. Luke 9.27. <hi>There bee som standing here which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</hi> So John 8.52. â <hi>Thou saiest, If a man keep my saying, hee shall never taste of death.</hi> And, Heb. 2.9.â<hi>that Jesus should taste death for everie one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chrysostom</hi> distinguisheth between <hi>Seeing</hi> and <hi>Tasteing</hi> death. <hi>Sed hallatinatur; eÃ³dem enim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidunt,</hi> saith<note n="*" place="margin">Drus. Praeter. pag. 82. &amp; 133.</note>
               <hi>Drusius. Chrysostom</hi> is out here, for they are the same. And indeed so they seem to bee by that of John 8.51, 52. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior haveing said, <hi>If a man keep my saying, hee shall not</hi> see <hi>death:</hi> the Jews made answer, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham is dead, and the Prophets: and thou saiest, If a man keep my saying, hee shall never</hi> taste <hi>of death;</hi> where wee have an explication as of the one by the other, so of both by a third. For, as to <hi>see sleep</hi> is to sleep; so to <hi>see</hi> or <hi>taste death,</hi> is to die. There is no surviveing such a sight. Death saie's, as God once to <hi>Moses, There shall no man</hi> see <hi>mee, and live,</hi> Exod. 33.20.</p>
            <p>Now by this <hi>death,</hi> which all must see, wee must understand not <hi>spiritual death;</hi> which is a separation of original righteousness from the soul, with an Intrusion of habitual concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence: nor <hi>eternal death;</hi> which is a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole man from the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54874:8"/> of God, and a punishing of him for ever in hell: (the one whereof answereth to the <hi>loss of Grace,</hi> the other to the <hi>filth of Sin.</hi>) but a <hi>corporal death;</hi> which is a separation of the soul from the bodie, or a dissolution of the frame of nature. Whether this <hi>corporal death</hi> shall bee <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>violent,</hi> whether in the <hi>morning,</hi> or <hi>meridian,</hi> or <hi>evening</hi> of our time; whether when wee are at <hi>home</hi> or <hi>abroad,</hi> and the like, hee onely knowe's that knowe's all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall hee deliver his Soul?]</hi> The Soul is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, incorruptible, immortal substance, and therefore no meat for the grave's mouth. There are in these lamentable times, when Truth is cried down, and Errors are cried up, that make a grave for the soul also; and this Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others they make their ground. Such I remit to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Tractate of <hi>Psychopannychia,</hi> and to another late one of a learned Autor, sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the <hi>Prerogative of Man,</hi> made by way of Answer to a Pamphlet asserting <hi>Whole Man's Mortalitie.</hi> Such doctrine cannot but bee verie comfortable to <hi>Flesh and blood,</hi> which <hi>cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50. But ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie prejudicial, if it were true, to the <hi>Children of the kingdom,</hi> who, when they com to the end of their daies, expect to receiv <hi>the end of their hope, the salvation of their souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.9. And surely they shall not bee <hi>ashamed of their hope,</hi> Psal. 119.116. Assoon as they <hi>rest from their labor,</hi> they shall receiv their pennie. Assoon as their work
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54874:9"/> is don, they shall hear that soul-ravishing word, <hi>Well don, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> Matth. 25.21, 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall hee deliver his Soul,</hi> in the text is, <hi>Shall hee deliver Himself?</hi> As the Bodie, so the Soul, is somtimes taken for the whole man. The Bodie, Rom. 12.1. <hi>I beseech you â that yee present your bodies a liveing sacrifice, &amp;c.</hi> So wee somtimes commend a person for a good bodie.<note place="margin">

Heb. 11.5. <hi>Elijah</hi> was <hi>put into a chariot of fire, and went up by a whirl-winde into heaven,</hi> 2 King. 2.11. and did not see it.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Solut.</note>I answer. First concerning <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That som conceiv, that these did <hi>see death;</hi> that the one was dissolved without anie pain when God took his soul. And that the other had his bodie burnt in his fierie chariot.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That, if they did not <hi>see</hi> death, (as it is more probable that they did not) yet they were <hi>Mortal,</hi> and as <hi>subject to death</hi> as anie that ever actually died.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning them that shall bee found alive at the comming of Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though they shall not <hi>sleep,</hi> they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54874:11"/> shall bee <hi>changed:</hi> so the Apostle telleth us, in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. And that change shall bee in stead of Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is sufficient that they are by nature <hi>obnoxious</hi> unto Death; haveing by sin deserved it, and Hell after it. And although by their sudden change they shall bee free'd from <hi>Death,</hi> yet from <hi>Hell</hi> they shall not; unless there bee wrought in them before that change, a <hi>spiritual</hi> change; and so a <hi>meetness</hi> for Heaven.</p>
            <p>The Reason of the Point is rendred by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of sin is death.</hi> This is the woful wages which God threatned to the first wicked work, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Of the tree of knowledg of good and evil thou shalt not eat; for in the daie that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And, if man, continuing in the state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, had died; it had com to pass either<note n="*" place="margin">Vide sis. Arch. Rubeum in lib. <hi>2.</hi> Sentent. dist. <hi>19.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>First, not through the disagrement of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For 1. against such a disagreement, hee had an excellent temper, and perfect health: so that one qualitie had not anie destructive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancie over another. 2. Hee had such an excellent power bestowed on his soul, that it could preserv his bodie from all distemper of humors, and all manner of infirmities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, nor through the decaie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of radical moisture</hi> For the radical moisture which was <hi>impaired</hi> by the natural heat, was <hi>repaired</hi> by his dailie food. And that Repairs might bee made equivalent to Losses, God provided the <hi>Tree of Life.</hi> Hence is that of <hi>Augustin,</hi>

               <hi>Adam had meat, that hee might not hunger; drink, that hee might not thirst; the Tree of Life, that hee might bee preserved from old age, and from death.</hi> This Tree of Life did so comfort and confirm his conversive and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive facultie, that it could not possibly bee weakened and fail: and consequently the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54874:12"/> approach of old age and death must needs have been hindered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, nor through anie external lesion or hurt.</hi> For 1. against extrinsecal Elements, hee had a most convenient temper of Air. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the injurie of evil Angels, hee had a guard of good ones. 3. All the beasts were then milde, and gentle, and obedient to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his dominion over them. 4. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all other things casually hurtful, hee had a great measure of prudence; so that hee could beware of them. 5. When mankinde had been increased and multiplied, all should have been just, and free from sin; none should have had the least injurious thought against his brother: if anie had offended that waie, hee had been presently expelled Paradise, as our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were.</p>
            <p>In one word wee may saie, That if man had <hi>continued</hi> in the state of Innocencie, his <hi>bodie</hi> had been preserved from all <hi>internal</hi> passion by his soul: and from all <hi>external,</hi> by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. Therefore it is evident, that if hee had not faln, hee had not actually died. <hi>Death is the daughter of disobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since man, if hee had continued in the state <label type="milestone">

            <p>The sum of all that hath been said, is this.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>that man, everie man is mortal:</hi> and that an exemption from Death, is no exemption from subjectedness or obnoxiousness unto Death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That man, had hee not sinned, had not been mortal. Mortal</hi> indeed hee was before his fall, <hi>potentiÃ¢ moriendi,</hi> by a possibilitie of dying. <hi>Erat posse mori, quia erat posse peccare.</hi> Death was possible, becaus sin was possible. <hi>Mortal</hi> hee was not <hi>necessitate naturae,</hi> by anie necessitie of nature: for his Bodie was of an excellent temper and constitution; his Humors were of so sweet an <hi>harmonie,</hi> that there was not the least <hi>jarring</hi> and disagreement among them. Yea, his <hi>Soul</hi> had power to preserv his Bodie from <hi>Death,</hi> so long as it preserved it self from <hi>sin.</hi> His radical moisture had been <hi>repaired</hi> by his food, as fast as <hi>impaired</hi> by his natural heat: the fruit of the Tree of Life had been as great a <hi>comfort</hi> to his nutritive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the <hi>honie</hi> was to fainting <hi>Jonathan.</hi> Neither Devils, nor beasts, nor anie thing had don him anie harm. Devils could not, beeing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54874:13"/> hindered by tutelarie Angels. Beasts would not, beeing readie to yeeld unto him all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Against <hi>casual</hi> inconveniences, God's <hi>providence,</hi> and his own <hi>prudence</hi> had been his <hi>protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>that man, if hee had not sinned, but continued immortal, should not have continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in Paradise;</hi> but at last should have been <hi>remooved</hi> into the place and presence of God.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Selah,</hi> or Application.</p>
            <p>Use 1. <hi>Since man is mortal, and must see death, Let us make no more of man then hee is.</hi> Apt wee are, (and it is our follie that wee are so apt) to <hi>magnifie</hi> overmuch, yea, to <hi>deÃ¯fie</hi> man. <hi>The voice of a god, and not of a man!</hi> was the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous voice of the foolish people concerning <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12.22.

                  </gap>.</note>
               <hi>confounding</hi> that so much magnified and admired Majestie. The people proclaimed him <hi>immortal;</hi> the Angel and the worms echoÃ«d, <hi>mortal.</hi> The Angel smote him, the worms ate him, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. Never was there a more certain and sudden demonstration of mortalitie then that was: and it may forever deterr men from makeing more of themselvs or others, then they ought to do. Three waies wee make more of men then wee ought: by excessive <hi>Fear,</hi> excessive <hi>Delight,</hi> excessive <hi>Confidence.</hi> All which wee must beware of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, of excessive Fear.</hi> And since man is a mortal thing, why should hee bee so terrible
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54874:14"/> unto us? See how God speak's to him that fear's man too much, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51.12, 13. <hi>Who art thou that thou shouldest bee afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man that shall bee made as grass? And hast feared continually everie daie, becaus of the furie of the oppressor, as if hee were readie to destroie? And where is the furie of the oppressor?</hi> As if God had said, What a fool art thou to bee afraid of a mortal man? to make as if hee were immortal and almightie. <hi>Furious oppressors</hi> there <hi>are,</hi> but suddenly they <hi>are not:</hi> for, <hi>where is the furie of the oppressor?</hi> both his furie and himself shall com to nothing: hee shall bee cut down as the grass, and his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie must then fall with him. Such a fear of man our Savior forbid's us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them which kill the bodie, but are not able to kill the soul.</hi> There are that make themselvs Gods, in killing the bodie; but they are not so much to bee feared, becaus they are not able to reach the soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Wee must beware of excessive Delight.</hi> And since man is a mortal thing, why should hee bee so much delighted in as commonly hee is? God allow's us to delight in one another; friend in friend, husband in wife, wife in hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, parents in children, children in parents, &amp;c. But our delight must bee <hi>moderate;</hi> wee must not forget that such objects are mortal. And wee shall do well to consider, that<note n="*" place="margin">Immodicis bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis est aetas, &amp; rara senectus. <hi>Mart. Epig.</hi> 29. <hi>lib.</hi> 6.</note>
               <hi>immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> delight in them is the next waie to lose them, and ourselvs too. How often hath God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54874:14"/> taken away <hi>a dear</hi> yoke-fellow, a childe, a friend, becaus hee hath been <hi>too dear,</hi> and too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in! Yea, how often hath the heart broke, when it hath been too much dilated and let out! 'Tis true, that of<note n="*" place="margin">Quem res plus nimio delectave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re secundae, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatae quatient; si quid mirabere, pones invitus. <hi>Hor.

               <hi>Flaccus, Answerable to our affection while wee enjoie a comfort, will bee our affliction when wee are deprived of it.</hi> And as good counsel, that of<note n="â " place="margin">Quicquid amas cupias non pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuisse nimis. <hi>Mart. Ep.</hi> 29. <hi>l.</hi> 6.</note>
               <hi>Martial, Whatsoever thou delightest in, delight not in it too much.</hi> It is wisdom (and so our dutie) to suffer our hearts so to <hi>laie hold</hi> on a comfort, that they may <hi>let it go</hi> again without anie eminent prejudice; so to <hi>injoie</hi> and <hi>joie</hi> in our friends, that when they <hi>die,</hi> yet wee may <hi>live;</hi> that their <hi>death</hi> may nor bee our <hi>death;</hi> that wee may follow them <hi>to</hi> the Grave, and not <hi>into</hi> the Grave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Wee must beware of excessive Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> And since man is a mortal thing, why should wee put such confidence in him? <hi>Put not your trust in Princes</hi> (saie's David) <hi>nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.</hi> Why? <hi>His breath goeth out, hee returneth to his earth: in that verie daie his thoughts perish, Psalm</hi> 146.3, 4. Mortal hee is, and not to bee confided in. Had hee been still immortal, hee had not been to bee trusted in; much less now. Manie a man build's high hopes on such or such a friend: hee trust's one daie to bee, or to do thus and thus: but his friend die's, and down fall<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
               </gap> his hopes to the verie ground. Thus <hi>Cesar Borgia,</hi> that wicked son of a more wicked father, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, grounded manie designs on his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54874:15"/> to that Pope. But the Pope suddenly die's, and dashe's all. And <hi>Borgia,</hi> when hee heard of his death, cried out, <hi>I never dreamed of such an accident: now all my purposes and projects are stifled, and com to nothing.</hi> Hee that know's man <hi>well,</hi> know's him <hi>too well</hi> to trust him <hi>too much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Use 2. <hi>Since man is mortal, and must see death, let him know himself, and bewail himself, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Know himself. David</hi> praie's to God <hi>to put the Heathen in fear, that they may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs to bee but men, Psalm</hi> 9.20. But men? Why, did they think themselvs to bee more then men? It seem's they did. <hi>Empedocles</hi>

Mortal hee knew himself, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of mortals hee accounted himself: and it will bee no sin, if everie man shall so account himself.

Therefore hee add's in the verie next vers: <hi>But yee shall die like men; and fall like one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Lest they should bee exalted through the abundance of honor, hee presently laie's their honor in the dust. <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Let man Bewail himself.</hi> How will a man bewail the loss of a fair and comfortable estate, when hee is sunk down into a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition! <hi>Call mee not Naomi,</hi> said shee, after her return to Bethlehem; <hi>call mee Marah: for the Lord hath dealt verie bitterly with mee. I went out full, and the Lord hath brought mee home again emptie, &amp;c. Ruth.</hi> 1.21. Wee cannot say the <hi>Lord</hi> hath made us <hi>mortal,</hi> but <hi>our selvs:</hi> wee might have continued <hi>happie</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi> still,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54874:16"/> had it not been our own <hi>fault</hi> and <hi>follie.</hi> The death of a dear friend strike's verie deep into us; specially if it hath been occasioned through our carelesness and imprudence. The loss of our immortalitie how should it <hi>affect</hi> and <hi>afflict</hi> us! How should the remembrance of it bee grievous to us! as the remembrance of Zion was to the Jews in Babylon. <hi>To have been happie,</hi> and not to bee so now, is a <hi>great unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. To have been immortal,</hi> (as wee were after a sort) and not to bee so still, but obnoxious to death; yea, more deaths then one, surely should bee oftner thought of, and more mourned for by us all, then usually it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Let man so know himself to bee mortal, and so bewail his mortalitie, as to Humble himself.</hi> And whosoever doth the first and second, will bee sure to do the third. A proud heart never troubled it self with the knowledg of it self, and sorrow for its mortall state: A proud <hi>eie</hi> never <hi>wept</hi> for it: A proud person is a verie stranger at home. But whosoever is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with himself, and wisely conside'rs the state of man, cannot but bee an humble man. Humble hee will bee</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Towards God,</hi> whom hee hath offended and dishonored by putting himself out of that most comfortable and happie condition of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie wherein God made him. A disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor it is to a father when his son suffer's him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to bee cheated and cast out of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and well may such a son bee ashamed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54874:16"/> to look his father in the face: and well may hee carrie himself with the lowest humilitie towards him all the daies of his life. The poor Prodigal com's to his father in a most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, humble, submissive sort; acknowledging, that haveing so dealt with him, and so undon himself, hee was <hi>no more worthie to bee called his son.</hi> Thus it is with everie childe of God: hee is full of sorrow and shame; hee <hi>creep's</hi> to God, and <hi>walk's</hi> humblie with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Towards man;</hi> Whom though hee may <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> in som inward or outward qualifications, yet hee <hi>despise's</hi> and <hi>disdain's</hi> him not; hee <hi>look's</hi> not upon him as <hi>God</hi> may upon <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>man</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>beast.</hi> For hee know's him to bee his <hi>equal,</hi> once no less <hi>immortal,</hi> now no more <hi>mortal</hi> then himself: and therefore carrie's himself in a loveing, lowlie, sweet, sociable manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him.</p>
            <p>Use 3. <hi>Since man is mortal and must see death, let him reflect with sorrow and detestation, upon that which hath put him into such a condition.</hi> God made him immortal; and if hee had been <hi>ruled</hi> by him, hee had still <hi>continued</hi> so, and never <hi>seen</hi> death. Sin <hi>onely</hi> made him mortal, and put him into a <hi>necessitie</hi> of dying.</p>
            <p>Sin therefore should bee</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Sorrowed for.</hi> First, and chiefly indeed, for the dishonor that was thereby don to so good and gracious a Maker: whom rather then to offend by the least degree of disobedience, wee should chuse to undergo the severest and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54874:17"/> greatest punishment that ever was or can bee inflicted. Secondly, for the dishonor and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that was thereby brought upon our selvs. 1. <hi>Dishonor;</hi> in that wee are made <hi>like the beast that perisheth.</hi> Between the bodie of a beast, and the bodie of a man, in respect of <hi>corruptibilitie,</hi> there is now no <hi>difference</hi> at all: the one return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the dust, and so doth the other. Manie a man when his estate is broken, his heart is broken too. To bee a bankrupt; to have been in great <hi>height,</hi> and now to <hi>fall,</hi> and break; to have <hi>shined</hi> gloriously, and now to bee in <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> to have been placed in the <hi>Firmament,</hi> and now to bee a fleeting <hi>meteor,</hi> is a great <hi>dishonor,</hi> and well may bee a stinging <hi>sorrow.</hi> That wee have so dishonoured our selvs by sin, that, as God said by an <hi>Ironie</hi> or <hi>Sarcasmus,</hi> Gen. 3.22. <hi>Behold! the man is becom as one of us, to know good or evil.</hi> So the <hi>beasts</hi> may most truly say, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!</hi> man is becom as one of us, to <hi>die</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to dust, even as wee: how should this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our hearts, and fill us with grief. 2. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>;</hi> in that when wee have ended this mortal <hi>life,</hi> wee are liable to eternal <hi>death.</hi> For by the first disobedience, wee not onely lost eternal <hi>happiness,</hi> (it had been som kinde of happiness to have staied there) but exposed our selvs to eternal <hi>miserie.</hi> So that, as the <hi>beasts</hi> may say, <hi>Behold!</hi> man is <hi>becom</hi> as one of us, in respect of <hi>mortal</hi> life: so the <hi>Devils</hi> may say, <hi>Behold!</hi> man is <hi>becom</hi> as one of us, in respect of <hi>eternal</hi> death: which without the infinite <hi>mercie</hi> of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54874:17"/> God, and <hi>merits</hi> of Christ, it is not possible for us to escape. How heavie their should that sin lie upon our hearts, which exposeth us to so woful a condition! But as it should bee sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for, so</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Detested and abhorred.</hi> How should our hearts hate and <hi>rise</hi> against that <hi>sin</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee <hi>fell!</hi> That by sin wee are becom <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> should put us into an <hi>immortal</hi> hatred of it. Wee should endevor the <hi>death</hi> of that which hath been the <hi>caus</hi> of our death. The <hi>first</hi> sin, (which was the mother of our miserie and mortalitie) wee can onely mourn and sorrow for. Original sin, wee must not onely <hi>mourn</hi> for, but <hi>mortifie.</hi> That <hi>bodie of death,</hi> (as the Apostle style's it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.) wee must everie daie, with all our might, <hi>wrastle</hi> with laboring to <hi>enervate</hi> and overthrow it. And thus if wee endeavor the <hi>death</hi> of Original sin, wee shall prevent the <hi>birth</hi> of Actual sin: as the stopping the <hi>fountain</hi> will bee the drying up the <hi>streams.</hi> And truly, this one thing well considered, That our mortalitie is the <hi>fruit</hi> of our sin, would bee sufficient to <hi>sharpen</hi> our hatred against, and <hi>work</hi> in us an <hi>abstinence</hi> from all sins vvhatsoever: and make us say, Shall I not bee avenged on the mother in the daughter, on the first sin in Original? Shall I <hi>dallie</hi> vvith, and <hi>indulge</hi> the <hi>daughter,</hi> vvhen the <hi>mother</hi> hath been my <hi>undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Shall I not, ought I not, to abstain from all, even the <hi>smallest</hi> sins, since the <hi>first</hi> hath prooved <hi>so</hi> pernicious? As the <hi>first</hi> made mee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54874:18"/> mortal, so the <hi>smallest</hi> is mortal. Were I now in the state of innocencie and immortalitie, as <hi>Adam</hi> once was, anie of the sins that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly committed, and accounted little, (an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious lie, a pettie oath, a wanton glance, yea, a wanton thought, and the like) would throw mee out of that happie condition, as that first sin did him, and make mee as mortal, as obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to death, to eternal death, as now I am. For <hi>all</hi> are of the <hi>same</hi> nature: and therefore I must take heed of, and abstain from all.</p>
            <p>Use 4. <hi>Since man is mortal, and must see death, Let him moderate his affections and hang loos to the things of this life. Wilt thou</hi> (saie's <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 23.5.) <hi>set thine eies upon that which is not? i. e.</hi> not permanent, nor certain. <hi>For riches cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make themselvs wings, they flie as an eagle towards heaven.</hi> It may as truly bee said, Wilt thou that art not, set thine eies on riches? for thou certainly art a mortal creature, and must one daie fall down into the earth. And when wee fall down thither, were <hi>carrie</hi> nothing with us, except a rag, and a flower, and a board, or, <hi>at best,</hi> a piece of lead. Gold, and silver, and houses, and lands, and the like, which wee are so <hi>wedded</hi> to, and dote on, while wee live, wee must of necessitie bee <hi>divorced</hi> from, when wee go down into the Grave.

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That according to our care or careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in prepareing for death, will bee our consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, and condition after it.</hi> With what a <hi>sad</hi> heart may an ungodlie man, that never <hi>made</hi> anie <hi>preparation</hi> for his death, lie upon his death-bed! Hee cannot fetch anie <hi>comfort</hi> from his <hi>former</hi> life. Hee consider's his <hi>neglect,</hi> or miserable <hi>misperformance</hi> of duties, his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of grace, his <hi>manifold</hi> sins against <hi>manifest</hi> conviction, which are now to his <hi>conscience,</hi> as so manie <hi>swords</hi> in his <hi>sides;</hi> and make him lie upon <hi>feathers</hi> as upon <hi>thorns.</hi> Hee saie's unto death as <hi>Ahab</hi> unto <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 King. 21.20. <hi>Hast thou found mee, O mine enemie?</hi> Heaven hee cannot <hi>hope</hi> for, and Hell hee cannot but <hi>fear:</hi> Hee could bee content to <hi>miss</hi> of Heaven, so that hee might escape Hell: Hee wishes that either <hi>himself</hi> or his <hi>sins</hi> had never had a <hi>beeing:</hi> and would bee willing to die a <hi>thousand</hi> deaths one after another, if thereby his sins might bee <hi>expiated,</hi> or himself <hi>annihilated.</hi> Hee considers God's <hi>mercie,</hi> but cannot <hi>comfort</hi> himself with it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54874:21"/> haveing so much <hi>abused</hi> it: hee <hi>look's</hi> on his <hi>Justice,</hi> as <hi>looking strictly</hi> on him, and readie to <hi>commit</hi> him to that <hi>infernal prison,</hi> from which there is no <hi>redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But with what a <hi>glad</hi> heart, and <hi>cheerful</hi> countenance may a <hi>godlie</hi> man, that <hi>prepare's</hi> for death, <hi>entertain</hi> it when it <hi>com's!</hi> It com's to him without a <hi>sting, (the sting of death is sin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56.) and therefore hee can <hi>safely take</hi> it, and <hi>put</hi> it into his <hi>bosom;</hi> as a man may a <hi>snake,</hi> when the <hi>sting</hi> is <hi>pulled</hi> out of it. Death is <hi>restorative</hi> to such a man, as the sight of the <hi>brazen</hi> Serpent was to them that were bitten with the <hi>fierie</hi> Serpents, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.9. It <hi>strike's</hi> indeed, but no otherwise then the Angel did <hi>Peter,</hi> to bring him out of prison, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.7. So death com's to the godlie, to <hi>deliver</hi> their souls from the<note n="*" place="margin">E corporum vinculis, tanquam Ã¨ carcere, evola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt. <hi>Cic. Som.

A godlie man <hi>expect's</hi> and <hi>prepare's</hi> for this guest, and therefore <hi>bid's</hi> it <hi>welcom.</hi> When men com up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us <hi>unexpected,</hi> and finde us not in such a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi> and readiness as wee <hi>desire,</hi> wee are not verie well <hi>pleased:</hi> and though wee <hi>love</hi> them well, wee could <hi>wish</hi> they had not <hi>com</hi> so <hi>soon.</hi> But if our selvs, and all about us bee in <hi>right order,</hi> the <hi>sooner</hi> they com, the <hi>better</hi> pleased wee are. So, to an <hi>unprepared</hi> heart, death strike's cold: but to a <hi>prepared</hi> one, it is as <hi>sleep</hi> to a wearie laborer; or <hi>cold waters</hi> to a thirstie soul; or <hi>good news</hi> from a far countrie: as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> speak's, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.25.</p>

            <p>How shall wee perpare for Death?</p>
            <p>First, <hi>By true repentance.</hi> Sin is the <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> caus of both first and second death. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance prevent's the <hi>second,</hi> and make's us readie for the <hi>first.</hi> Let death com when it will, it com's not <hi>unseasonably</hi> to a repentant soul, that hath endevoured to wash it self white again in it own tears: this <hi>washing work</hi> wee must do everie daie.

            <p>Secondly, <hi>By taking heed of all such things as must bee repented of. Do</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Cujus poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendum fuerit, nÃ¨ feceris. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misisse cave quod mox mutare la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bores.</note>
               <hi>nothing</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards thou must <hi>griev</hi> for, and <hi>wish undon;</hi> is a good rule: If wee observ it well, it will <hi>preserv</hi> us in such a <hi>sweet</hi> frame of spirit, as will make our lives <hi>comfortable,</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> us for <hi>parting</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>By leaving nothing undon till death approacheth, which ought to bee don before.</hi> To this most difficult work of dying well, what things are requisite I told you before. Now <hi>all</hi> our time is <hi>little enough</hi> for the acquireing of them. And the <hi>greatest</hi> measure of them that wee can get, wee shall finde <hi>little</hi> enough vvhen wee com to make our <hi>last</hi> use of them. It is <hi>utmost</hi> follie to <hi>neglect</hi> Grace, till wee are <hi>ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> into the Grave, and the lamp of our life is going out. Yet thus it is with the greatest
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54874:22"/> number of men. When they perceiv death comming to them, <hi>then</hi> they will provide for it, <hi>then</hi> they will repent, and beleev, and call upon God, and make their peace with Heaven. Thus the Devil <hi>blinde's</hi> and <hi>besot's</hi> them: thus they listen to his lure, and rather suffer him to <hi>cozen</hi> them into a <hi>conceit</hi> of dying well, though they never <hi>cared</hi> for liveing well, then God to <hi>perswade</hi> them, That if they would <hi>die well,</hi> they must <hi>live so;</hi> that they must provide <hi>all</hi> their daies for their <hi>last</hi> daie; that Repentance, and Faith, and other Graces are of more<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>By doing nothing in which wee would bee unwilling that death should finde us.</hi> Wee would bee loth that death should finde us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>idle,</hi> or <hi>ill-emploied:</hi> that it should finde us not onely in anie ungodlie, unjust, intemperate action, but with an oath, or a curs, or a <hi>scoff,</hi> or a lie, or an obscene, wanton, foolish, <hi>idle</hi> word in our mouthes: yea, with anie sinful <hi>thought</hi> in our hearts. Abstain wee then care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from all these. For these vvill make death most unvvelcom to us; becaus they argue an utter unpreparedness for it: novv vvhere
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54874:23"/> an <hi>unpreparedness</hi> is, there death is never <hi>welcom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>By doing all that wee do in such a sort, as if death were to seiz upon us in the verie act.</hi> Let a man <hi>so</hi> read, and hear, and praie, and sing Psalms, and communicate, and confer, and do <hi>all</hi> other actions, as if they vvere to bee his <hi>last,</hi> and hee vvill do them <hi>so</hi> sincerely, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, self-denyingly, as is possible for him to do; and so vvill bee in a preparedness for death, vvhensoever it shall com.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>By the dailie meditation of death.</hi> Death is the first of those<note n="*" place="margin">Mors tua, mors Christi, fraus mundi, gloria coeli, Et dolor inferni, sunt meditanda tibi.</note> five things vvhich are commended to everie man's meditation. And vvhosoever shall think frequently vvith himself thus: <hi>Dust I am, and to dust I must return,</hi> Gen. 3.18. <hi>My earthlie hous of this tabernacle must bee dissolved,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. <hi>Here I have no continuing citie,</hi> Hebr. 13.14. Neither noble parentage, nor large patrimonie, nor high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, nor vast riches, nor excellent beautie, nor firm strength, nor rare endovvments, nor <hi>anie thing,</hi> can keep life and soul, or <hi>rather</hi> soul and bodie alvvaies together: implacable death, maugre all that the most learned Physicians can do to the contrarie, vvill at last <hi>plunder</hi> this <hi>earthlie</hi> hous, and make mee <hi>keep open hous</hi> for everie <hi>worm</hi> that com's. Sin hath put mee into a <hi>necessitie</hi> of departing hence: it is God's <hi>mercie</hi> that I have continued thus <hi>long</hi> undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; hovv soon his Justice may command my dissolution, hee onely knovv's: obnoxious
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54874:23"/> I am everie <hi>moment</hi> to the devourer of men: Death may <hi>sweep</hi> away this <hi>dust</hi> this verie <hi>daie,</hi> yea, this <hi>hour,</hi> yea this <hi>minute,</hi> while I am in the mention of it: <hi>Wheresoever</hi> I am, <hi>whatsoever</hi> I do, I may bee reached by the <hi>inevitable</hi> stroak of <hi>impartial</hi> death. Whosoever, I say, shall frequently think thus with himself, shall finde the fruit of it. <hi>Such</hi> a man, and <hi>onely such</hi> a man, is <hi>likely</hi> to bee <hi>ripe</hi> and <hi>readie</hi> for death, com when it will: like a <hi>good hous-keeper</hi> that keep's a constant table, and hath alwaies great store of good provision about his hous, fit to entertain anie guest that com's. <hi>Such</hi> a man is likelie to have his heart in order, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts even, and to look death in the face with joie, and to take well all that death doth, as knowing that (as one said,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of this Countie's greatest Glories. An Extract of a most Antient Familie. But a dis-esteemer of Birth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Worth. Wherein hee out-shone the brightest of his noble Ancestors. A singular and much honored Patriot. Witness the supreme Court of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Whither hee was frequently sent by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and fervent suffrages of his endeared Countrie. His great Estate none could either bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manage, or bee less servant to. What Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie laid up, Liberalitie and Magnificence laid out. A loyal Consort, a numerous Off-spring, and great abundance of Attendents were never bles't with a better Governor. His servant's Sickness was his Sympathie, and their Recoverie his Cost. Beeing thus a Father in a Master toward his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, what must hee bee in a Father toward his most lovelie Children, and in an Husband to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his most beloved Ladie? To his Table
<pb facs="tcp:54874:35"/> (which was alwaies choisly sumptuous) all Good men were ever most welcom; especially if Profes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sors of either Sacred or Secular Learning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though hee were so rare a proficient, that hee was accounted a Living Librarie; yet was hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly acted with an impetuous desire after a greater hight. His Gate was not less propitious to the Poor: whose Valediction to it was a Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; their Farewel an heartie Praier for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's welfare. Manie poor Laborers hee daily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied, chiefly, That they might not by doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, learn to do wors. Manie Neighbor-Towns hee yearly refreshed, sending unto them plentiful Provision. The Great Hors was his great delight. Manie hee had, as generous and elegant as anie were; which hee frequently backed with as much skill as anie could. Had hee not better known to moderate his Hors then Himself, (for from his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light arose his Diseas) Hee, in whom his Familie, Friends, Countie, Countrie, were so happie, and then whom none was more happie on Earth, had not yet been most happie in Heaven. Our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness set, and his arose, <hi>Decemb. VIII. M. DC. XL.</hi> In the <hi>LVI</hi> yeer of his Age.</p>
